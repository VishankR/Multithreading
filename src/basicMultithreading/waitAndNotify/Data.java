    /*Let's break down what's going on here:

    1. The packet variable denotes the data that is being transferred over the network.
    2. We have a boolean variable transfer, which the Sender and Receiver will use for synchronization:
        i - If this variable is true, the Receiver should wait for Sender to send the message.
        ii - If it's false, Sender should wait for Receiver to receive the message.
    3. The Sender uses send() method to send data to the Receiver:
        i - If transfer is false, we'll wait by calling wait() on this thread.
        ii - But when it is true, we toggle the status, set our message and call notifyAll() to wake up other
             threads to specify that a significant event has occurred and they can check if they can continue execution.
    4. Similarly, the Receiver will use receive() method:
        i - If the transfer was set to false by Sender, only it will proceed, otherwise we'll call wait() on this thread.
        ii - When the condition is met, we toggle the status, notify all waiting threads to wake up and return the data
             packet that was Receiver.*/
